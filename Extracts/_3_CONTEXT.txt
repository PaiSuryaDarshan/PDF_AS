Page 4: one may think of monomers as occupying the vertices of a periodic lattice, and the chemical bonds as corresponding to the edges joining these vertices at any given moment, with some probability p. Then, the gel point can be identified with the percolation threshold pc, where, in the thermodynamic limit, the incipient â€“
