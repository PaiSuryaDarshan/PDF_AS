Page 6: Fluorescence technique is quiet useful for monitoring solâ€“gel transition which has been well established that fluorescence and phosphorescence intensities of aromatic molecules are affected by both radiative and non-radiative processes.53 Whereas, the radiative probabilities are relatively independent of the environment and even of molecular species, non-radiative transitions are affected by the environmental
