Page 3: chemical gel appears during a random cross-linking process of monomers to larger and larger molecules. The whole course of the bulk free radical polymerization is divided into three different stages: low conversion stage, gel effect stage and glass effect stage.4 Radical chain polymerizations are characterized by the presence of
